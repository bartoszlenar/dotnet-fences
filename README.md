### Versioning

[Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) is being used very strictly. The major version is updated only when there is a breaking change, no matter how small it might be (e.g., adding extra method to the public interface). On the other hand, a huge pack of new features will bump the minor version only.

Before every major version update, at least one preview version is published.

### Licencing
